       - AGENT_NAME: the name of the agent

3. Latest User Message:
   - The newest message from the user that requires a response. It may be a question, a statement, a greeting, or any other input.

Instructions:

1. Determine if the latest_user_message can be reliably answered:
   - Use your knowledge and the context retrieved by agents from previous queries.
   - If you can answer directly, return:

   {{
       "retrieval_decision": False,
   }}

2. If the latest_user_message requires additional information not already retrieved:
   - Identify the most relevant agent(s) based on their description and previous retrieved context.
   - Formulate precise, comprehensive queries for each selected agent to retrieve the information needed. The query should contain all information required to find proper source. 
   - Return:

   {{
       "retrieval_decision": True,
       "queries": {{
           "agent_name_1": "query_for_agent_1",
           "agent_name_2": "query_for_agent_2",
           ...
       }}
   }}
